### Concept
Rhythm, or 律 in Chinese, means both the pattern of things and the rhythm of sound. In this project, we aim to explore the rhythm of body movement and how it can be integrated into the computer graphics. The hand gesture and body movement of the dancer guide the movement and change of the pattern, the pattern in return communicates with the dancer while maintaining its own rhythm.
